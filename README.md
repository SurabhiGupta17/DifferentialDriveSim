# DifferentialDriveSim
This project is a 2D simulation focused on learning and implementing differential drive kinematics and PID control from scratch using Pygame. The goal is to explore and understand the mathematical foundations behind differential drive robots and PID control systems by building a custom simulation from the ground up.
